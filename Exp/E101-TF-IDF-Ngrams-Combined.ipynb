      "Q: what is coronavirus\n",
      "A:  Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans. \n",
      "Q: keep my family safe\n",
      "A:  Teach and reinforce everyday preventive actions.\n",
      "Parents and caretakers play an important role in teaching children to wash their hands. Explain that hand\n",
      "washing can keep them healthy and stop the virus from spreading to others.\n",
      "Be a good role model—if you wash your hands often, they’re more likely to do the same.\n",
      "Make handwashing a family activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: signs\n",
      "A:  If you develop any of the following emergency warning signs for COVID-19, get medical attention immediately by calling your doctor's office. Emergency warning signs include (but are not limited to):\n",
      "\n",
      "Trouble breathing\n",
      "Persistent pain or pressure in the chest\n",
      "New confusion or inability to arouse\n",
      "Bluish lips or face\n",
      "Q: testing where\n",
      "A:  There are actually many tests being used to diagnose COVID-19 that the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) has\n",
      "authorized for use during the current emergency. All of these viral tests identify the virus in samples from the\n",
      "respiratory system, such as from nasal or nasopharyngeal swabs. Some tests are conducted at the testing site you\n",
      "visit, and results are available to you within minutes. Other tests must be sent to a laboratory to analyze, a process\n",
      "that takes 1-2 days once the lab receives your samples. Two tests allow you to collect your own sample at home –\n",
      "either a nasal swab  or a saliva sample  – but you will still need to send the sample to a lab for processing.\n",
      "Locations and types of testing sites vary depending on where you live (see question: Where can I get tested). Check\n",

      "Q: depression\n",
      "A:  A novel coronavirus is a new coronavirus that has not been previously identied. The virus causing coronavirus\n",
      "disease 2019 (COVID-19), is not the same as the coronaviruses that commonly circulate among humans and cause\n",
      "mild illness, like the common cold.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: can the virus cause depression\n",
      "A:  Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air. \n",
      "Q: when will it end\n",
      "A:  According to the World Health Organization, all available evidence suggests that the novel coronavirus first appeared in China at the end of 2019 and was not manipulated or produced in a laboratory.\n",
      "Q: does it kill people\n",
      "A:  Developing a vaccine takes time, in most cases several years, as they need to undergo extensive testing in clinical trials to determine their safety and efficacy.\n",
      "Q:  What is CDC doing about COVID-19\n",
      "A:  CDC is working with other federal partners in a whole-of-government response. This is an emerging, rapidly evolving\n",
      "situation and CDC will continue to provide updated information as it becomes available. CDC works 24/7 to protect\n",
      "people’s health. More information about CDC’s response to COVID-19 is available online.\n",

      "Q: do we have treatement?\n",
      "A:  Generally coronaviruses survive for shorter periods at higher temperatures and higher humidity than in cooler or\n",

      "based cuto for inactivation at this point. The necessary temperature would also be based on the materials of the\n",
      "surface, the environment, etc. Regardless of temperature please follow CDC’s guidance for cleaning and disinfection.\n",

      "\n",
      "Q: jogging\n",
      "A:  No. The majority of transmissions of this virus occur through droplet transmission. This means that a sick patient who coughs or sneezes is expelling virus through droplets that don’t travel that far. They tend to fall to surfaces within a six-foot distance. If you touch a surface that is contaminated with droplets from someone who has coughed or sneezed on it and then you touch your eyes or nose or mouth, you could potentially become infected that way. \n",
      "Q: pregnant women\n",
      "A:  So far, we haven’t seen any particular data that pregnant women are at greater risk. However, there is significant concern that this may be the case.\n",
      "Q: Should I stay inside the house\n",
      "A:  Yes. This virus has been very hard to control, which suggests asymptomatic transmission, and there have been a number of studies documenting asymptomatic transmission. That’s one reason why you should stay home if someone in your household may have coronavirus infection.\n"
