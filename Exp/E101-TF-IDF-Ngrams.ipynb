      "A:  Although we know certain bacteria and fungi can be carried on fur and hair, there is no evidence that viruses,\n",
      "including the virus that causes COVID-19, can spread to people from the skin, fur, or hair of pets.\n",
      "However, because animals can sometimes carry other germs that can make people sick, it’s always a good idea to\n",

      "\n",
      "Q: what coronavirus\n",
      "A:  Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which occur naturally in animals and may cause illness in animals and humans. In humans, coronaviruses cause respiratory infections ranging from common colds with mild symptoms to more severe diseases such as the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently discovered virus in this family causes the Coronavirus Disease, COVID-19.\n",
      "Q: what is covid-19\n",
      "A:  The Coronavirus Disease is a flu-like respiratory disease that is highly contagious.\n",
      "Q: keep my family safe\n",
      "A:  Watch your child for any signs of illness. If you see any sign of illness consistent with symptoms of COVID-19, particularly fever, cough, or shortness of breath, call your healthcare provider and keep your child at home and away from others as much as possible.Follow CDC’s guidance on “What to do if you are sick.”\n",

      "mild illness, like the common cold.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: can the virus cause depression\n",
      "A:  Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air. \n",

      "Q: when will it end\n",
      "A:  CDC and partners are investigating to determine if you can get sick with COVID-19 more than once. At this time, we are\n",
      "not sure if you can become re-infected. Until we know more, continue to take steps to protect yourself and others.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: does it kill people\n",
